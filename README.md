# PF2E Visioner ‚Äì Full Feature Overview

**PF2E Visioner** is a powerful, modular token management system for Foundry VTT tailored to the Pathfinder Second Edition (PF2E) ruleset. It provides GMs with complete control over how each token perceives others (visibility) and their cover status, integrating deeply with PF2E's visibility and cover mechanics.
