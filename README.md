# PF2E Visioner ‚Äì Advanced Visibility and Cover Toolkit

PF2E Visioner is a comprehensive visibility and cover toolkit for Foundry VTT's Pathfinder 2nd Edition system. It provides granular control over what each creature can see, automates PF2E perception mechanics, and offers an intuitive user experience for both GMs and players.

1. Install the module in Foundry's Add-on Modules.
2. Enable it for your world.
3. Configure world settings (Game Settings ‚Üí Module Settings ‚Üí PF2E Visioner).

---

## üîç Core Capabilities

### Per‚ÄëObserver Visibility States

- Visibility is tracked for each observer‚Üítarget pair.
- States: Observed, Concealed, Hidden, Undetected.
- State data lives in token flags; it's robust across reloads and scenes.

### Per‚ÄëObserver Cover States

- Cover is tracked for each attacker‚Üítarget pair.
- States: None, Lesser (+1), Standard (+2), Greater (+4).
- Cover data is stored per pair and only applied to mechanics at roll time (see Auto Cover below).

### Token Manager UI (Visibility & Cover)

- Modern ApplicationV2 UI with responsive layout and fixed controls.
- Color-coded rows, hover to highlight tokens on the canvas, sortable table.
- "Apply All" and "Revert All" flows with per‚Äërow apply/revert.
- Cover and visibility tabs use consistent iconography and colors.
- Quick panel for rapid visibility/cover adjustments between selected and targeted tokens.

### Visual Feedback

- Token overlays/filters reflect current visibility.
- Smooth transitions when states change.
- Hover tooltips communicate "how this token sees others" or "how others see this token" depending on mode.
- Icon badges above tokens for quick visual reference.
- Colorblind mode support with multiple palette options.

## ü´† PF2E Action Automation

Visioner enhances PF2E chat cards with buttons that open result dialogs and apply changes safely.

### Actions Covered

- Seek
- Hide
- Sneak
- Point Out
- Create a Diversion
- Take Cover
- Attack Consequences (post‚Äëattack visibility updates for hidden/undetected attackers)

### Shared Dialog Features

- Preview changes before applying
- Encounter filtering toggle
- Outcome/margin display
- Per‚Äërow apply/revert and bulk actions

### Chat Automation Behavior (GM‚Äëfirst, player‚Äësafe)

#### Seek

- With setting "Use Seek Template" ON:
  - GM and players get "Setup Seek Template".
  - Player‚Äëplaced templates create a GM‚Äëside pending request. GM sees "Open Seek Results" only when the area contains valid targets; otherwise GM sees no button. Using a template disables range limits.
  - GM‚Äëplaced templates open the dialog immediately.
- With the setting OFF: GM sees "Open Seek Results"; players see nothing.
- Optional range limits (in/out of combat) apply when not using a template.
- Support for seeking loot tokens and hazards with configurable Stealth DCs.

#### Point Out

- Players do not see a Point Out button.
- Player Point Out auto‚Äëforwards to GM:
  - GM sees "Open Point Out Results" only if allies will benefit; otherwise no button is shown.
  - One‚ÄëPing Rule: ping once on GM receipt (not on dialog open). GM‚Äëinitiated Point Out pings when opening.
- Results set allies' visibility of the target to Hidden (PF2E rules).

#### Hide / Sneak / Create a Diversion

- Open result dialogs from chat.
- Visioner detects applicable tokens (filtered by allies/enemies setting and encounter filter).
- Apply/revert changes per‚Äërow or in bulk.
- RAW enforcement options for stricter rule adherence.

#### Attack Consequences

- When a hidden/undetected creature deals damage, a red dialog appears to apply resulting visibility changes following PF2E guidance.

#### Take Cover

- Supports both chat card actions and system effects conversion.
- Integrates with auto-cover system for DC reductions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Auto Cover & Roll Overrides

When enabled, Visioner evaluates cover between the acting token and its current target and applies the appropriate bonus to the target's AC for that roll only.

### How it works

- On attack/spell-attack rolls, Visioner computes cover just-in-time and injects a one‚Äëshot effect to the target so the DC/AC reflects the chosen cover.
- After the roll's chat message renders, Visioner cleans up any one‚Äëshot cover effect.
- If a token moves during an active attack flow, Visioner clears any previously applied cover; re‚Äëevaluation happens at the moment of rolling.

### Modifiers dialog (with dialog open)

- GMs see a "Visioner Cover Override" row with four icon buttons: None, Lesser, Standard, Greater.
- The auto-calculated state is highlighted; click another icon to override for that roll.
- Uses Visioner's shield icons and colors throughout the module.

### Quick rolls (no dialog)

- Bind a key in Controls to: "Hold to Override Cover on Quick Rolls" (no default binding).
- Hold that key while clicking a strike to open a compact override window (AppV2) with the same four icons and a Roll button.
- Pick a cover; Visioner applies it for that roll and then cleans up automatically.

### Auto‚ÄëCover options (world settings)

- Enable Auto‚ÄëCover: master toggle.
- Token Intersection Mode: how token blockers count (Any, 10%, Center, Side Coverage, Tactical, 3D Sampling).
- Ignore Undetected Blockers: attackers ignore blockers they can't detect per Visioner visibility map.
- Ignore Dead Tokens: skip 0‚ÄëHP blockers.
- Ignore Allies: skip same‚Äëalliance blockers.
- Respect Token Ignore Flag: tokens with `flags.pf2e-visioner.ignoreAutoCover = true` won't provide cover.
- Prone Tokens Can Block: when off, prone tokens are skipped as blockers.
- Visualization Only in Encounter: limit cover visualization to active encounters.
- GM Respects Line of Sight: GMs see cover visualization limited to explored areas.

### Cover Visualization System

- Hold configurable keybind (default: Y) while hovering over targets to activate.
- Shows colored grid overlay indicating cover levels at each position against hovered token.
- Color coding: Green (No Cover), Yellow (Lesser +1 AC), Orange (Standard +2 AC), Red (Greater +4 AC).
- White square highlights selected token's current position.
- Dynamic range calculation automatically expands to cover all tokens on scene.
- Works for all auto-cover intersection modes.
- Client-specific rendering - each player sees only their own visualization.
- Player-configurable keybindings via FoundryVTT's native Controls settings.
- Optional encounter-only restriction setting.
- Smart occupation filtering - excludes squares occupied by other tokens (except tiny creatures sharing space).

- Wall config ‚Üí under Visioner settings turn on hidden wall checkbox.
- Set DC if you want for seeking/discovering walls.
- Walls auto start as hidden for tokens.

## üîß Developer API (minimal)

```js
const api = game.modules.get('pf2e-visioner')?.api;
await api?.openVisibilityManager(token);
```

- getVisibility(observerId, targetId)
- setVisibility(observerId, targetId, state)
- updateTokenVisuals(token?)
- getVisibilityStates()
- getCoverBetween(observerId, targetId)
- setCoverBetween(observerId, targetId, state)
- getCoverStates()
- getAutoCoverState(attackerToken, targetToken)
- clearAllSceneData()

See `scripts/api.js` for the current surface.

---

## üß© Rule Elements

Visioner ships a `PF2eVisionerVisibility` rule element for item‚Äëdriven visibility. See `RULE_ELEMENTS.md` for schema, fields, and examples.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

- No button on chat card?
  - For Seek: ensure a valid template was placed (if template mode is ON), or that range limits allow targets.
  - For Point Out: the GM only sees a button if allies will benefit.
- Socketlib missing? Cross‚Äëclient perception refresh will not broadcast; only local canvas refreshes.
- Already‚Äëopen chat message? The GM panel re‚Äërenders on player handoff; if you still don't see updates, refocus the message or toggle the chat log.
